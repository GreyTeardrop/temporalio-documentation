A large company (Name TBD) routinely hires new employees. Every Candidate's job offer is subject to a Background Check.

Some of the more common checks in a Background Check include:

- SSN trace for known aliases and addresses
- Federal criminal records check
- State criminal records check
- County civil records check
- County criminal records check
- Municipal criminal records check
- Employment verification
- Education verification
- Motor vehicle history
- Drug & health screen

Depending on the position, the Background Check of the Candidate could include any the individual checks.
If the Candidate is associated with multiple addresses, then multiple state level, county level, and municipal level checks could occur.
Some of the checks can be done against public facing databases, others may require parsing PDFs or images.
With each individual check, there is an opportunity for something to happen that can cause a delay.

The Company is fully aware that the current methods used to conduct a Background Check for a Candidate are not scaling with the rate of hiring.
So, the Company wants to automate as much of the Background Check process as it can to save time and improve the experience for everyone involved.

If this sounds familiar, it is because Checkr has built a product that does this.
Checkr is the leading tech company in the Background Check industry. It should not be a surprise that one of the most common reasons to use Checkr is for conducting Background Checks as part of the hiring process.

For this learning path, we are going to walk through some of the problems that the {Company} might face while automating the Background Check process and how they can solve them by using the Temporal Platform, just as Checkr did.
